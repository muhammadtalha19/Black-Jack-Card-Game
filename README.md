## How to Play Blackjack (for Beginners)

### Objective
- Get a hand total **closer to 21 than the dealer**.
- If you go over 21, that‚Äôs a **bust**, and you automatically lose.

## Card Values
- Number cards (2-10): Face value
- Face cards (J, Q, K): 10 points
- Ace (A): **11 points**, but switches to **1** if counting it as 11 would bust your hand.

## Game Flow

1. You‚Äôll be asked **how many games** you want to play.
2. Each game starts by dealing **2 cards to you and 2 to the dealer** (1 hidden).
3. You can choose to:
   - **Hit (h)** ‚Üí Get another card.
   - **Stand (s)** ‚Üí Keep your current hand.
4. If your total goes over 21, you **bust** and lose.
5. Once you stand, the **dealer reveals their hand** and draws until reaching **17 or more**.
6. Winner is decided:
   - Closest to 21 wins.
   - Equal totals = Tie
   - Blackjack (an Ace + 10/J/Q/K) right away = Instant win.
